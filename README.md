# Prague Metro & Tram Timetables - Android Application

## Prague Public Transport Companion

## Overview

This project is an Android application designed to provide users in Prague with easy access to metro and tram timetables. The app aims to offer a modern, user-friendly experience leveraging the latest Android development tools and design principles, including Jetpack Compose and Material You.

The core functionality will revolve around displaying accurate and up-to-date public transport schedules to help users navigate Prague efficiently.

## Planned Features

- **Timetable Access:**
    - Browse and search for Metro line schedules.
    - Browse and search for Tram line schedules.
    - View departure and arrival times for specific stations.
    - Real-time updates (if accessible via a public API).
- **User Interface & Experience:**
    - Modern Material You design.
    - Intuitive bottom navigation with three main sections:
        1. **Timetables/Search:** Main section for looking up lines and station schedules.
        2. **(To Be Defined Section 2):** e.g., Map View, Route Planner, or Nearby Stops.
        3. **(To Be Defined Section 3):** e.g., Favorites, Service Alerts, or Settings.
    - Light and Dark theme support.
- **Offline Access:**
    - Ability to cache timetable data for offline use (where feasible).
- **Favorites:**
    - Allow users to save frequently used lines or stations for quick access.
- **(Potentially) Service Alerts:**
    - Display information about disruptions or changes in service, if available.

## Technology Stack

- **Programming Language:** Kotlin
- **UI Toolkit:** Jetpack Compose (for declarative UI development)
- **Architecture:** MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) or similar modern Android architecture pattern.
- **Asynchronous Programming:** Kotlin Coroutines & Flow
- **Dependency Injection:** Hilt (recommended)
- **Networking:** Retrofit / Ktor (for API communication if a public API is used)
- **Local Storage:** Room Persistence Library (for caching data, favorites)
- **Navigation:** Jetpack Navigation Component (for Compose)
- **Design Language:** Material You (Material Design 3)
- **Build Tool:** Gradle

## Project Structure

The project aims to follow a feature-based modularization approach for better organization and scalability. Key directories will include:

- `core/`: Shared components like navigation, theming, utilities.
- `data/`: Data sources (local and remote), repositories, domain models.
- `di/`: Dependency injection modules.
- `ui/`: Feature-specific UI screens (Composables) and ViewModels.
    - `feature_timetables/`
    - `feature_section2/` (placeholder for the second navigation item)
    - `feature_section3/` (placeholder for the third navigation item)

(A more detailed file structure was previously outlined and should be referred to for specifics.)

## Setup & Build

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    
    ```

2. **Open in Android Studio:**
    - Ensure you have the latest stable version of Android Studio.
    - Select "Open an Existing Project" and navigate to the cloned directory.
3. **Build the project:**
    - Android Studio should automatically sync Gradle files.
    - Click "Build" > "Make Project" or run the app on an emulator/device.
